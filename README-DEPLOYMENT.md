# 🚨 STOP $48 BILLING! 

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **DELETE both existing apps** in Digital Ocean Dashboard
2. **Choose ONE deployment method below**

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED: Single Service ($12/month)**

**✅ This is the SAFEST option to avoid dual billing**

### Steps:
1. Go to [Digital Ocean Apps](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. **Delete existing apps** 
3. Click "Create App" → "GitHub" → Select `b2b_email_outreach`
4. **Upload the `app-single.yaml` file as your app spec**
5. Add environment variables (see below)
6. Deploy

### What you get:
- ✅ Admin Dashboard (web interface)
- ✅ Background Automation (24/7)
- ✅ **Only $12/month** (one service)
- ✅ No billing confusion

---

## ⚙️ **ADVANCED: Two Services ($24/month)**

**⚠️ Only use if you understand the risks**

Use `app.yaml` for separate dashboard + worker services.

---

## 🔧 **Environment Variables to Add:**

After creating the app, add these in DO dashboard:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
EMAIL_ACCOUNT=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
APIFY_API_KEY=your_apify_key_here
```

---

## 📋 **Quick Deploy Commands:**

```bash
# Remove problematic files that cause dual detection
git rm Dockerfile docker-compose.yml
git commit -m "Remove files causing dual app detection"
git push origin main

# Then deploy using app-single.yaml in DO dashboard
```

---

## ✅ **Success Indicators:**

- **Single app** in DO dashboard
- **$12/month** total cost  
- **Dashboard accessible** via URL
- **Automation running** in background

---

## 🆘 **If Still Getting $48:**

1. **Delete ALL apps** in DO dashboard
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. **Only use `app-single.yaml`**
4. **Never upload both files**

The issue was having both Dockerfile and Python files causing DO to create separate apps. Now fixed! 🎉
